## regexpm — Simple Regular Expression Matcher

**regexpm** is a lightweight Java project that implements a **custom regular expression matcher** from scratch. Instead of relying on Java’s built-in regex engine, it uses a **context-free grammar** and a **recursive descent parser** to parse and evaluate regular expressions.

This project is intended primarily for **learning and experimentation**, demonstrating how regular expression engines can be built at a fundamental level.

### Features

* Custom regular expression matching engine
* Recursive descent parser implementation
* Grammar-based regex parsing
* Pure Java, no external dependencies
* Minimal and easy-to-read codebase

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore the internal mechanics of regular expression processing, making it useful for:

* Learning parsing and compiler-style techniques
* Understanding how regex engines work internally
* Experimenting with or extending regex behavior
* Educational demonstrations and small JVM tools

### Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Approach:** Context-free grammar + recursive descent parsing

### Status

This project is a work in progress and focuses on clarity and educational value rather than full regex feature parity or performance optimization.

If you want, I can also:

* Shorten it for a **repo tagline**
* Add **usage examples**
* Write a **Features / Grammar / Architecture** section
* Polish it for a **portfolio project**
